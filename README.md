# ABOUT
This is a small app project using the react-big-calendar, react-datepicker packages. \
It is a simple calendar app that allows you to add events to the calendar and view them. \
The app was built using ReactJS, TypeScript, and SCSS (although I haven't really done much styling in this project).
